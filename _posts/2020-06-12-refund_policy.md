title: Fee and Refund Policy 2020 Outdoor season of Play
---
In a normal soccer season, costs are easily estimated and registration fees are
set accordingly. With the Covid-19 pandemic, some costs cannot be 
estimated, and there is a risk that the soccer season will be cancelled
mid-season, for health and safety reasons.  
  
It is anticipated that outdoor soccer registration fees will be reduced because
of the shorter soccer season. Full details of the new reduced fees, if they
happen, are not yet known.  
  
CYSA is a non-profit, volunteer run organization, and we are doing are best to balance these priorities:  
* Provide safe recreational soccer for Charleswood youth.  
* Charge appropriate registration fees.  
* Provide registration fee refunds, automatically when appropriate, and as requested.  
* Avoid losing money, which would prevent CYSA from providing recreational soccer in the future.  
* Do all of the above without over-burdening our volunteers.  
  
Refunds for over-payment amounts will be automatically issued, if the refunded amount is greater than $10 per player, once the season has ended.  
  
Because of the unpredictable nature of Covid-19, CYSA will handle refund situations as detailed below.  
  
1. A refund requested prior to training sessions (i.e. practices) beginning:  
  
   Full refund upon request.  
  
2. If the soccer season is cancelled after training sessions begin but before scheduled games are played:  
  
   CYSA must still pay for some overhead costs in this scenario (e.g. insurance costs), and cannot refund the full registration fee.  
  
   The refunded amount will be the registration fee with overhead costs deducted. The estimated overhead cost is $60 per player, but the overhead cost is not yet known.  
  
   Using the original registration fee amount, estimates of the refund amounts in this case are as follows:  
  
   |Age Group|Registration Fee|Estimated overhead costs|Estimated Refund|  
   |U13-U18|$240|$60|$180|  
   |U11-U12|$220|$60|$160|  
   |U9-U10|$180|$60|$120|  
  
3. If a refund is requested after training sessions begin but the soccer season has not been cancelled:  
  
   For example, a parent may choose to withdraw their child from soccer because of health and safety concerns after games have begun.  
  
   CYSA will compassionately consider these requests on a case by case basis. A refund is not guaranteed in these cases.  
  
4. If the soccer season is cancelled after training sessions begin and after scheduled games have started:  
  
   A refund amount will be calculated that considers the overhead costs (e.g. insurance costs) plus the costs incurred to run the shortened season (e.g. costs for jerseys, referees, field lining, etc.).  
  
   If the refunded amount is greater than $10 per player, refunds will be automatically issued.  
  
5. If a refund is requested after the soccer season is completed as scheduled:  
   
   The refund request will fall under the standard CYSA policy: [CYSA Registration Policy]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/CYSA-Registration%20Policy%202018-12-03.pdf)
