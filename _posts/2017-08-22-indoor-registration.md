title: 2017 Indoor Soccer Registration
---
Recreational indoor soccer for ages 9 through 18 runs from late October to the middle of March.  Regular registration is now over.  If you wish to register late, please send an email to registration@cysawinnipeg.com giving the player's name, date of birth and address, so that we can check if there is space.

The fee for all players from ages 9 until 18 is $335.

Note that CYSA offers programs in recreational soccer.  To register for the Developmental and Premier levels of indoor soccer, please visit the St Charles Soccer Website at www.stcharles-soccer.com for more information.

For ages 5 through 8 the St Charles District is running a program at the University of Winnipeg.

See [District Programs](http://www.stcharles-soccer.com/index.php?src=gendocs&ref=Mini%20Academy&category=District%20Programs)  for details.

 

Days and places of play


Normally, boys play on Sundays and girls on Saturdays, but there are sometimes evening games as well.  Games will be played at the WSF facility at the University of Manitoba, the WSF facility at Garden City, and the University of Winnipeg.

 

Note the following catchment information.

For ages 9 and up, WYSA regulates where your child can play.  The place of residence of your child determines which community club catchment area the child is in, and that is where you register.  In the case of CYSA, we handle soccer for the following community clubs:

Varsity View

Roblin Park

Westdale

i.e. south of the river and west of the west border of the Assiniboine Forest (extended down to the City Limits).  If you live north of the Assiniboine River in the St Charles district, register with your local community club, even if you have played on a Charleswood team in the past.  For Elie area, register with Tracy Carriere in Elie (phone 204-353-2972 or tracycarriere@hotmail.com).  

Historically, we have registered Headingley in our district and Headingley is part of our bylaws, but the Manitoba Soccer Association is altering how they handle registrations outside of the City of Winnipeg.   For Headingley/Cartier residents who wish to register with CYSA, please go to the Manitoba Soccer Association website at manitobasoccer.ca, go to About -> Policies -> Administration and fill out the Out of Region Transfer Request form in order to request playing inside Winnipeg.  There is a $20 fee for this transfer request.  You can register with us so that your registration gets into us in time for team formation, but you still need permission from the MSA.  Note that the above only applies for ages 9 through 18 - for mini-soccer there are no restrictions.

 

Kidsport, Jumpstart subsidies

There are several programs which subsidize enrollment in soccer for those with difficulty financing these programs.  The primary one of these is the Kidsport program at www.kidsportcanada.ca.  If you wish to apply for this, we will have forms available at in-person registration (not on-line).  However, please note that if your application is not accepted (there is a means test) you will be responsible for paying the full registration amount.  There is also a program called Jumpstart, run by Canadian Tire.
