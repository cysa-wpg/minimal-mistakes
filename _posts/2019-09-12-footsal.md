## What is Futsal?
Futsal is a unique, fast-paced indoor sport played across Canada and around the world [(canadasoccer.com)](https://www.canadasoccer.com/futsal-team-s14677).
 
Similar to football/soccer, it also shares certain characteristics with other
team sports (basketball, water polo, handball), resulting in a game that is
unique. Futsal requires a high rate of active participation and motor
engagement on the part of the players, which makes it an excellent means of
developing skills among children. It enables them to stay constantly involved
in the game – directly or indirectly – and build up the amount of time they
spend engaged in useful practice (or intense practice), which is why the sport
is also regarded as an excellent training tool for football [(uefa.com)](https://www.uefa.com).
 
Globally, futsal is growing steadily as more and more member associations
become familiar with and appreciate the positive impact this variation of
football can have on the development of a boy or girl’s technique, variable
skill sets, tactical understanding, coordination and agility. With only five
players on each side and reduced size goals on a pitch almost eight times
smaller than a conventional football pitch, the need for skillful, imaginative
play with precise technical execution is paramount. Tight spaces, fast-moving
action, quick decisions and end-to-end play with transitions are key to futsal
success, making this a challenging but enjoyable format of football [(fifa.com)](https://www.fifa.com/futsal/index.html).
