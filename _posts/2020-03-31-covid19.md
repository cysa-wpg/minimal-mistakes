title: Covid-19 Message

A message to all CYSA families,  

With the COVID-19 situation continuing to evolve on a daily basis many are
asking what to expect for the 2020 outdoor soccer season. At this time no
decisions have been made and so we are asking for your patience as we await
further direction.  

The health and safety of our players, team officials, volunteers and families
is of the utmost importance to CYSA and we will follow all recommendations as
issued by Health Canada and/or our governing bodies. We remain cautiously
optimistic and are continuing to organize and plan for the upcoming season of
play while also planning to address any possible contingencies should the
season need to be adjusted, shortened or cancelled in its entirety.  

Updates will be sent by email to all registrants as well as posted to our
Facebook page as more information becomes available. Please be assured that we
are continuing to assess the situation as it evolves. Thank you for your
patience and understanding during this challenging time.  

Take Care,  
Erin Beyko
