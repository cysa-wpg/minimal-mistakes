**Mini-Soccer or House League Additional Information**

The emphasis in mini-soccer and the primary goal at this age is to develop in
players early physical literacy and a love for the game. For this reason no
scores or standings are kept and the focus is on fun small sided games.

This program is designed for players in the under 4 to under 8 divisions as
determined by year of birth. Each division is co-ed with players being randomly
allocated to rosters. The number of teams in each division will be determined by
the number of registrations received. The teams in each division will play with
one another in a rotating schedule at a single location with multiple fields.

**Season of Play**

The season runs from early May until late June concluding with the CYSA
Mini-soccer Jamboree, a Canada Soccer’s Active Start Soccer Fest which is held
on a Saturday in late June. 

Players are given the option to choose night of play with the options being
Monday and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday evenings both options run from 6:30
PM - 7:30 PM.

Each player will be contacted in April by their coach, who will pass on
important information and season details.  

**Skills Development**

Early skill development is encouraged through the use of small sided games and smaller team,
field and ball sizes. All players are given equal amounts of playing time and are encouraged to have lots of touches on the ball throughout
the practice and game time.

Nights of play are split into a practice period followed by a game period.
At the beginning of the season the one hour session is divided into a 40
minute practice period and a 20 minute game period. As the season continues the
one hour session will progress into a 30 minute practice period and a 30 minute
game period.

The practice time is built around four activity stations, one
focusing on general movement skills, one on coordination, one on soccer
technique and another on small-sided games. Each field will be split into these
four stations and the two teams assigned to that field will combine for the
practice period. Groupings of players will move from one skill-building
activity to the next at regularly timed intervals.

The stations will be assigned by a weekly schedule, during the eight week
season. These stations provide the youngest player (U4-U6) with the opportunity
to develop basic movement skills such as running, throwing, catching, jumping,
landing and kicking built around informal play and positive reinforcement.

For the children in U7-U8 divisions each pillar of soccer; technique,
dribbling, control, passing and shooting, will be covered twice during each
season.  Coaches will also have the opportunity to bring their own drills into
the mix.  Addressing all four of these training pillars at each practice
session will help develop well-rounded young players with a foundation in
physical literacy, solid soccer skills and, ideally, an enduring love of the
game. 

**Coaching** 

Coaching is provided by the players family members who volunteer their time.
Organization, support, practice plans and equipment will be provided by the
house league convenor/CYSA executive. 

All coaches are expected to adhere to the CYSA team officials code of conduct,
complete the Respect in sport for activity leaders on-line course and attend a
coaching clinic.

Additional clinics offered by The Manitoba Soccer Association (MSA) within the
community coaching pathway are strongly recommended. The first stage is the
Active Start program designed for those coaching players U4 to U6. The second
stage, FUNdamentals, is designed for those coaching players U6 to U8. All fees
for these coaching courses will be reimbursed. 

**Spectators** 

Spectators are expected to follow the CYSA Code of Conduct at all times. A
parent or someone they designate must be present throughout the duration of all
games and practices to supervise their child.  Coaches cannot be responsible
for all the children on their team at these age.  It is also expected that at
this level of play spectators will support the coach and assist them when asked
to do so. 

**Equipment** 

Each player will receive a jersey which is theirs to keep as well as a medal at
the conclusion of the season. It is recommended that all players are provided
with shin guards and soccer socks which can be worn over either runners or
soccer cleats. All players should bring a water bottle and a regulation size 3
ball to each night of play.
